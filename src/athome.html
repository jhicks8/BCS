	<h2>Welcome</h2>
	<p>Community Center located next to Imaginary Park has been a cornerstone of our
	community for nearly 10 years. We offer a wide array of classes and sporting events
	for you and your family to enjoy. There is something for all ages! It also serves as
	a multipurpose space for community events, meetings, lectures, and activities! We 
	look forward to seeing you soon.</p>
	
	<h3><a href="services.html">Services</a></h3>
	<p>We offer a wide range of services: from clubs and classes to at-home nursing for the
	elderly. A community that learns and plays together, stays together! If you have a large
	event coming up and need a venue, our great hall is available for rental. Create a lasting
	memory of your wedding/bar mitsvah/communion/anything surronded by friends and family right
	here in the community center. </p>
	
	<h3><a href="donate.html">Donate</a></h3>
	<p>Our Community center is prodominately funded by donations from members of the community. 
	We greatly appreciate any aid you feel comfortable providing. You can sign your name to be 
	listed on our list of donors or can donate anonymously!</p>
	
	<h3><a href="volunteer.html">Volunteer</a></h3>
	<p>Most of our services are offered and run by community volunteers. We are always in need of 
	another pair of helpful hands. No experience required, only a can-do attitude. </p>
	<p>Have a special knowledge or expertese in something you'd like to share with the world?
	Contact one of our employee's to see if you're a good fit to teach a community center class
	or coach one of our many kid's sports teams!</p>
